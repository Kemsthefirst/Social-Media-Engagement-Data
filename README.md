Identify patterns in user interactions.

Detect anomalies and outliers in engagement metrics.

Provide actionable marketing insights based on data-driven observations.

# Key Findings:
Engagement levels vary by post type, with photos and videos receiving higher interactions.

Midweek posts (Wednesday and Thursday) show higher engagement.

Some posts exhibit extreme outliers in likes and shares, indicating viral content.

This report is part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) task for the HNG Internship program. The goal is to develop effective data-driven marketing strategies.
